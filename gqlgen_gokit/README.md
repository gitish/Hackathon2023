gqlgen and gokit are two popular open source Golang frameworks:

## gqlgen:

* It is a GraphQL server library written in Go to build GraphQL APIs and services using Golang.
* Enables quicker and easier development of GraphQL backends that can provide flexible data fetching and manipulation compared to REST APIs.
* It provides useful helpers and ways to autogenerate resolvers, models etc based on schema definitions.
* Key features include things like out of box support for realtime subscriptions, modularity, authentication layers and auto persistence handling.

## gokit:

* It is a Microservices toolkit written in Golang to help structured development of microservices along best practices.
* Provides common patterns and reusable components like service discovery, RPC communication, request handling/response processing, middleware chaining etc.
* Allows developers to focus more on business logic rather than recreating plumbing around handling distributed services concerns like tracing, metrics, logging etc.
* Overall reduces boilerplate code around building independently deployable, production-grade microservices in Go.

In summary, gqlgen accelerates building modern GraphQL backends while gokit simplifies general Go based microservices architecture and delivery by providing reusable libraries and patterns.
