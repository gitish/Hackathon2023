## Green Coding & Sustainability Comparison

Green coding refers to the practice of developing and designing software applications, platforms, and services in a sustainable way that minimizes the environmental impact resulting from the computing systems used and digital activities performed.
Some core principles and practices of green coding include:

* Optimizing energy efficiency of software by reducing CPU cycles, network calls, and resource usage improving carbon footprint
* Using server, hardware and database consolidation approaches like virtualization and containerization to cut down on hardware waste and energy needs
* Implementing data encryption and transmission mechanisms that require less processing overheads
* Building software capabilities focused on enabling paperless workflows and activities to conserve resources
* Designing algorithms, software architectural patterns optimized for electrical efficiency of the underlying processor infrastructure
* Leveraging renewable energy sources for powering tech systems involved in SDLC workflows â€“ coding, testing, hosting etc.
* Promoting recyclability and disposal of expired computing infrastructure in environmentally friendly ways

In essence, green coding aims to apply an "eco-friendliness first" mindset throughout software conceptualization, design, development and even infrastructure maintenance activities. The goal is to engineer sustainable software.
 
Here are some ways to demonstrate green coding practices locally on your own development systems:
1. Enable power saving settings on your computer to optimize CPU/GPU energy use when idle. Most OSes like Windows, Linux, Mac provide such options.
2. Monitor overall system resource consumption with open source tools like Monitorix. This allows identifying efficiency improvement areas.
3. Virtualize environments using VirtualBox/Vagrant rather than having multiple systems. Avoids hardware waste.
4. Profile code execution to identify optimizations for computation, memory, I/O heavy operations. Improve algorithm/query efficiencies.
5. Containerize applications through Docker to enable lightweight, optimized resource standardization and sharing.
6. Leverage execution throttling and request caching mechanisms within code to reduce executions. Improves speed and energy usage.
7. Implement renewable/low-emission energy sources locally. For example, solar charging of laptops/small boards.
8. Contribute to sustainability focused open source projects to promote awareness.
 
These serve as some starter ideas for demonstration. The key is continuously analyzing ways to boost software efficiency while reducing the carbon footprint of our digital systems and workflows.
