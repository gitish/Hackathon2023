## Insight generation using ML 

* Here is one approach to get started with using machine learning for transactional insight generation:
Data Gathering Collect historical transaction data from relevant sources.
This includes fields like - customer info, product/service purchased, payment mode, location, timestamp, amount etc. Gather data spread over adequate duration.

Data Preprocessing Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers/errors, transforming fields as needed.
Also derive helpful features with business context from the raw data.
Exploratory Analysis Gain some basic insights by visualizing and analyzing trends in different transaction
attributes - frequency, size, category preferences etc across segments and timelines.

ML Model Selection Based on the initial data patterns observed and type of transaction insights desired, determine suitable ML algorithms like classification, clustering, forecasting or anomalies detection.

Feature Engineering Feed in right explanatory variables into the model that correlate with the transaction 
insights we want to predict - like customer lifetime value, resubscription odds, fraudulent transactions etc.
Model Training Train and optimize the predictive ML model based on available historical transaction data using techniques like cross-validation.

Model Evaluation Evaluate real world model performance by checking metrics like precision, 
recall and accuracy relevant to the business problem trying to be solved.
